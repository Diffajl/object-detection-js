# Object Detection with React and TensorFlow.js

## Description
This project demonstrates how to perform object detection in the browser using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Webcam**, and **TensorFlow.js** with the **COCO-SSD** model. The application captures video from the user's webcam and performs real-time object detection, displaying bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using COCO-SSD model
- User-friendly interface built with React
- Modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- Webcam integration using React Webcam
- Fast development and build times with Vite

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Webcam**: Webcam component for React
- **TensorFlow.js**: Library for machine learning in the browser
- **COCO-SSD Model**: Pretrained object detection model for TensorFlow.js
